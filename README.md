# Python-premodeling
This project developed by a group of for students for INDITEX is a comprehensive data analysis project that utilizes Python programming language. The names of the students that participated in this project are included in the document. The project utilizes three different datasets provided by INDITEX, which were imported into the notebook using appropriate libraries.

The first step of the project is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the team analyzed the basic information of the data, including possible errors and everything that should be included in the EDA step. Then we identified and handled any missing values in the dataset, either by deleting or filling them as needed. We also managed any outliers present in the data.

The next step of the project was Feature Engineering, where we manage to create many new features using external APIs and also engineered the current data we had. Some examples of these new features are temperature, GDP, habitants, etc.

After that, we did a Train-Test split of the data and handled categorical variables by using both one hot encoding and target encoding. Finally, the data  had been scaled to prepare it for modeling.

Overall, the project includes detailed comments and explanations for every step taken in the notebook, making it easy to understand and follow the process.
